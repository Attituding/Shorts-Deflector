            How Do We Use Your Data?
        </Title>
        <Paragraph>
            <Text>
                All data collected by this extension is for the express purpose of redirecting or changing YouTube Shorts pages.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                Tab information is used to detect when you load a new webpage, to test if it is a YouTube Shorts page, and to test if you want this extension to be active on that page. Site content is used to replace YouTube Shorts URLs to normal YouTube links. Settings are used to modify the extension's behavior and keep track of your preferences.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                No data collected listed above is used for analytics, monitoring, or similar. This extension does not send anything to the developer/publisher, nor any third parties.

            How Do We Collect Your Data?
        </Title>
        <Paragraph>
            <Text>
                This extension collects some data through APIs provided by your browser. For example, when you load a webpage, your browsers tells this extension that a webpage has loaded, and provides information such as a tab Id and URL.
            </Text>
            <Text>
                For collecting site content, a script is injected into all YouTube webpages that collects all the links present on that page. If you opt into the enhanced performance option, the scope increases from just YouTube webpages to all webpages (excluding local files and protected webpages).
            </Text>
            <Text>
                User inputs are collected when you change a setting.
