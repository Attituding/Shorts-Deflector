# Introduction

Why does clicking on a YouTube Short on a desktop bring up the mobile-optimized interface? With no video scrubbing, harder to access comments, less accessible view count, and more, it makes no sense to use on a desktop.

Shorts Deflector is an extension that allows you to seamlessly watch YouTube Shorts with the normal desktop interface. By using several techniques, this extension is super fast; you will barely notice the switch to the desktop viewer. Install now and try it out for yourself!

Upon install, the "Read your browsing history" permission may seem alarming, but this permission is only used to detect page updates.
