## Shorts Deflector
Why does clicking on a Short on desktop bring up the stupid interface with no video scrubbing, harder to access comments, harder to access comment, etc?

Shorts Deflector is a browser extension that redirects youtube.com/shorts/xyz to youtube.com/watch?v=xyz.

Best paired with uBlock Origin, which you can use to remove the Shorts item on the YouTube navigation menu permanently.
