# Introduction
Why does clicking on a YouTube Short on a desktop bring up the mobile-optimized interface? With no video scrubbing, harder to access comments, less accessible view count, and more, it makes no sense to use on a desktop.

Shorts Deflector is an extension that allows you to easily watch YouTube Shorts with the normal desktop interface.

Note: The "Read your browsing history" permission may seem alarming, but this permission is only used to detect page updates.
