# Introduction
Why does clicking on a YouTube Short on a desktop bring up the mobile-optimized interface? With no video scrubbing, harder to access comments, less accessible view count, and more, it makes no sense to use on a desktop.

Shorts Deflector is an extension that allows you to seamlessly watch YouTube Shorts with the normal desktop interface. By using several techniques, this extension is super fast; you will barely notice the switch to the desktop viewer. Install now and try it out for yourself!
