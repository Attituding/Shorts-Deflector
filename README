## Shorts Deflector
Shorts Deflector is a browser extension that redirects youtube.com/shorts/xyz to youtube.com/watch?v=xyz.

No longer will you click on a video and see the cumbersome Shorts format.

Best paired with uBlock Origin, which you can use to remove the Shorts item on the YouTube navigation menu permanently.
